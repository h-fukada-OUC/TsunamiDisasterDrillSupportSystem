Title: 

Proposal and evaluation of tsunami disaster drill support system using tablet computer

Abstract: 

In Japan, for tsunami disaster prevention, the government prepares tsunami hazard maps and provides them to residents. 
However, residents often do not examine the provided maps. 
Thus, these maps are not well utilized. In this study, we focused on the offline Geographic Information System and proposed a tsunami disaster drill support system that displays a tsunami hazard map, the current location, and route for the users. 
Using a prototype of the proposed system, we conducted an evaluation for the same in the Otaru City, Hokkaido. 
The results showed that the basic functions of the proposed system were mostly favorable for the evacuation process.
